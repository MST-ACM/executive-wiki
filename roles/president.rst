President
==========

Roles and Responsibilities
--------------------------
+ **Company Relations** - The President is the primary face of ACM to
  companies. The President should work with these companies to include them in
  more events, to sync up on their goals and missions with ACM, and to continue
  to build the relationships with ACM Executives and students.
+ **Fundraising** - The President should work with the treasurer to help create
  a budget for ACM and all of the SIGs. With these goals in mind, the President
  must then work to raise money to pay for these expenses in conjuction with the
  SIGs. The President should should also gather extra money for any emergency or
  unexpected expenses.
+ **Manage ACM** - The President is responsible for all things ACM: ensuring
  that events go over well, making sure the SIGs have everything they need,
  etc.
+ **Plot ACM's Future** - ACM should always continue to innovate new ideas and
  events. While this can be done by anyone, the President should make it a
  primary effort on how to innovate ACM whether through creating new events,
  updating old events, coming up with new ideas, or anything else.

Transition Steps
----------------
1. Email companies and introduce the main point of contact to the new President.
   **TODO**: Add a contact list.
2. Add the to the `ACM Team Drive
   <https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0ACRic8oZ2IZ4Uk9PVA>`_ (if you
   cannot access it, open in incognito mode).
3. Give the access to `bitwarden account <http://bitwarden.com/>`_ and
   keypass.
4. Add to ACM Global Account.

General Tips
------------
+ **Share Responsibilities** - The ACM Executive board is a team there for a
  common goal of helping ACM grow. Many people who take the ACM President role
  have the personality to try to do everything themselves, but there are
  specific roles in ACM for a reason. Spend the work around to the appropriate
  roles so that everyone is contributing but no one is burned out.
+ **Show Gratitude** - While everyone there volunteered to be on the Executive
  board, they volunteered and should be in turned thanked for all the effort
  they put in. Bring in food once in and while, make sure to have a one-on-one
  chat with someone to tell them what a great job they're doing, etc.
+ **Develop the Team** - Working on a the ACM Executive board is a great
  opportunity to develop problem solving skills, working as a team, and
  communication. Be sure to faciliate developing these skills for the team and
  yourself.

Running an Executive Meeting
----------------------------
In the past, ACM President has been responsible for driving all of the ACM
Executive meetings. This may change in the future to the Vice President -
Internal, but these tips can be transferred over to that documentation at a
later time. Here are some general tips for running an executive meeting:

+ **Build a Schedule and Stick to It** - Make sure that meetings have a purpose
  and everyone is aware where you are and where you are going. The morning of
  the meeting (or earlier), spend time to develop an agenda and send it out to
  the Executive Board for them to review. During the meeting, ensure that you
  stick to the agenda and only stray from it for a specific reason.
+ **Include Everyone** - Try to only talk about things that are pertinent to
  everyone so no one is bored. Sometimes this cannot be avoided, but you should
  avoid catching up with specific sigs for prolonged periods of time. If it is
  specific to a SIG and the rest of the group does not need to be present,
  attend their officer meetings and discuss it directly with them.
+ **Past, Present, and Future** - One way to structure a meeting is to start the
  meeting with discussing what happened in the past, move onto things that are
  currently happen, and then discuss the future. Moreover, start the meeting
  with smaller topics and end with topics that take longer to discusss.
+ **Ask Questions and Drive Creativity** - You should drive conversation to
  develop the best solutions rather than assume you know the best solution.
+ **Decide Arguments with Reason not Authority** - Arguments will eventually
  happen in the Executive board, but they should always be decided by which is
  the best solution for everyone.
+ **We are All Here for a Common Goal** - Never forget that even when you are
  upset with something or some decision, everyone is there for a common goal.
  Disagreements should attack ideas and make sure they are the best.

Tenative Schedule
-----------------
This tenative schedule will provide a good sense of what to do month over month
as ACM President. The schedule should be continually revised and updated so
that tasks and events are properly planned for.

Summer
^^^^^^
+ **Sponsorships** - Q1 (January) and Q3 (August) are the primary times that
  companies look for sponsorship opportunities due to budgeting. You should 
  spend a lot of time reaching out to companies to acquire sponsorships that 
  meet your projected funding goals. Before the summer is over, you should have 
  ideally secured 5,000+ in funding.
+ **Career Fair Dinner** - If unfamiliar, please look at the
  :ref:`events-career-fair-dinner` section. Take a look at the companies
  attending the `MST career fair <https://career.mst.edu/careerfair/>`_ and
  attempt to contact any looking for computer science / computer engineering
  jobs. Look at the :ref:`events-career-fair-dinner` section for more specific
  detials.
+ **Talks** - ACM should attempt to get 3 companies talks for the months of
  September, October, and November. **TODO**: Add secion on ACM Talks
+ **Develop a Fall Semester Plan** - Loosly determine month by month what you
  want to accomplish and talk about over the months to develop a rough plan for
  the semester.

August
^^^^^^
+ **Recruitment** - August is the primary time for recruiting new
  members into ACM and the SIGs. Many people spend August looking for a new club
  to join or just look to get involved. ACM meetings should be focused on
  recruitment plans and planning the **ACM Recruitment Drive**. More
  information on the **ACM Recruitment Drive** can be found in the
  :ref:`events-recruitment-drive` section.
+ **Budgets** - Work with the treasurer and the SIGs to build a budget for all
  of ACM.

September
^^^^^^^^^
September is the busiest month of the entire ACM calendar due to the fall career
fair. Be sure to delegate out tasks so that no one gets burned out and make sure
to over-communicate with everyone what is going on.

+ **ACM Goals** - Work with the SIGs to develop goals for the semester and the
  year. Build solid plans for ensuring theses goals are met and review progress
  as the semester and the year progresses.
+ **ACM Events** - Try to finalize the events for the the rest of the semester.
  Ideally you should have at most 2 events a month (except for september) and at
  most 1 a night.
+ **Career Fair Dinner** - Finish planning the career fair dinner and finalize
  everyone who will be attending.
+ **Review Recruitment Procesess** - Check-in on how recruitment went and plan
  for ways to improve for next semester.


October
^^^^^^^
+ **Try out a New Event** - Since it is right in the center, October would be a
  good time to trial run a new event. See if you can come up with something
  creative for a small amount of money that will attract new people. 
+ **Review How September Went** - Did the companies enjoy the talks and the
  career fair dinner? What can we do next time to make sure things run smoother?
  Is there anything that could improve on to attract more companies or people?
+ **ACM Events** - Make sure that ACM events are still on schedule (MegaMiner,
  etc.).

November
^^^^^^^^
+ **Planning for Next Semester** - Spend some time thinking about next semester.
  What new events do we want to try? What things can be improved for next
  semester?

December
^^^^^^^^
+ **Review how the semester went** - Did ACM meet its goals? Did the SIGs meet
  their goals? If not, what can be done next semester to reach them. If so, how
  can we build upon these goals to improve.
+ **Sponsorship Letter** - Take a look at the sponsorship letter. See if there
  are any improvements that could be made to provide more value to sponsors and
  ACM.
+ **Constitution** - Review the constitution. Ensure that everything is still up
  to date and being followed by the Executive Board.

Christmas Break
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+ **Career Fair Dinner** - Review the companies attending the spring career
  fair and email any looking for computer science / computer engineering roles. 
+ **ACM Talks** - ACM should attempt to get 3 talks for February, March, and
  April.
+ **Sponsorship** - Re-email any company who told you to get back to them next
  year, email new companies that you have not yet contacted for sponsorship, and
  follow up with companies that said no with the revised sponsorship letter to
  see if they are now interested.
+ **Develop a Spring Semester Plan** - Loosly determine month by month what you
  want to accomplish and talk about over the months to develop a rough plan for
  the semester.

Future Ideas
------------
+ **Resume and Interviewing Workshop** - Many companies have mentioned that S&T
  students are weak in their interviewing skills. A good event would be to teach
  students how to technically interview and build the best resume.
