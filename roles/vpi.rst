  efficiently.

  Make sure all comments are heard and that no one's comments are suppressed by
  other members of the board.
  Be familiar with the constitution and follow it as strictly as possible.
  This will ensure that no one is treated unfairly and poor decisions are less
  often to occur.
  This also means that the VP-I's job to make sure that S&T ACM's branding never
  breaks university policy, and that the constitution is up to date and
  compliant with regulation.
+ **Manage Elections** -
  The VP-I is in charge of all Election details.
  This includes announcments, scheduling, vote proceedings, and counting votes.
  Do so ethically, as you will be checked.
+ **Plan Events** -
  The Vice President External (VP-E) is in charge of all ACM events.
  The VPI should ensure the VPE has all the help they need to handle events

  The VP-I and VP-E are the President's strongest allies.
  Be available and helpful to anyone in the Executive Board when possible, as it
  is the job.
  

Transition Steps
----------------
1. Ensure the new VP-I has access to the ACM Team Drive.
2. Introduce the new VP-I to the committee chairs and the new and old President,
   VP-E, and Treasurer.

First Day
---------
1. Read the constitution in full, and form a strong understanding of its 
   contents.
2. Read about Robert's Rules of Order.
   These won't be used often, but the ideas and concepts should be well
   understood in case they are necessary.
3. Spend some time discussing ideas for the next year of ACM with it's new
   President.
4. Learn about approval voting, as it will be used in S&T ACM elections.
5. Acquire an `ACM Global Membership
   <https://campus.acm.org/public/qj/quickjoin/qj_control.cfm?promo=PWEBTOP&form_type=Student>`_.
   It is $19 dollars for students. The President, Vice President, and Treasurer
   are required to be ACM Global members.

Parliamentarian Tasks
---------------------
1. Take notes at the meetings, note important points made, but not names unless
   necessary.
2. Make sure conversations stay on topic, if the group gets off track, remind
   the Board to get back on topic.
   If that does not work, the President and VP-I's job is to enact Robert's
   Rules of Order.
   Speak this and make it known that the rules are in place now if the Board
   does not understand or comply.
3. Interrupt if members of the Board are not being allowed to speak.
   Everyone deserves their chance to speak, so if someone is being too loud, let
   them know that others have to speak, and call on those who are not being
   heard.

Lessons Learned
---------------
+ Go to events and meetings, otherwise you will not be up to date and have
  relevant information.
