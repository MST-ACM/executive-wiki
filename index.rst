ACM Executive Wiki
==================
Welcome to the **ACM Executive Wiki**! This wiki provides ACM Executives with
resources to help run ACM events, manage administrative tasks, and general
questions about ACM. 

The wiki has been created in an effort to remove the amount of information ACM
Executives need to 'just know' when starting. One of the hardest part about
being an Executive is simplying knowing what to do and how things were done in
the past. Please be sure to keep this documentation up to date and include any
new information overtime.

.. warning::
    This wiki is only as good as the information maintained within it. If future
    years would like to utilitize this wiki, be sure to keep it up to date and
    constantly reference it.
