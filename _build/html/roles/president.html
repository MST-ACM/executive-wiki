<h2>Roles and Responsibilities<a class="headerlink" href="#roles-and-responsibilities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Company Relations</strong> - The President is the primary face of ACM to
companies. The President should work with these companies to include them in
more events, to sync up on their goals and missions with ACM, and to continue
to build the relationships with ACM Executives and students.</li>
<li><strong>Fundraising</strong> - The President should work with the treasurer to help create
a budget for ACM and all of the SIGs. With these goals in mind, the President
must then work to raise money to pay for these expenses in conjuction with the
SIGs. The President should should also gather extra money for any emergency or
unexpected expenses.</li>
<li><strong>Manage ACM</strong> - The President is responsible for all things ACM: ensuring
that events go over well, making sure the SIGs have everything they need,
etc.</li>
<li><strong>Plot ACM’s Future</strong> - ACM should always continue to innovate new ideas and
events. While this can be done by anyone, the President should make it a
primary effort on how to innovate ACM whether through creating new events,
updating old events, coming up with new ideas, or anything else.</li>

<h2>General Tips<a class="headerlink" href="#general-tips" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Share Responsibilities</strong> - The ACM Executive board is a team there for a
common goal of helping ACM grow. Many people who take the ACM President role
have the personality to try to do everything themselves, but there are
specific roles in ACM for a reason. Spend the work around to the appropriate
roles so that everyone is contributing but no one is burned out.</li>
<li><strong>Show Gratitude</strong> - While everyone there volunteered to be on the Executive
board, they volunteered and should be in turned thanked for all the effort
they put in. Bring in food once in and while, make sure to have a one-on-one
chat with someone to tell them what a great job they’re doing, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Develop the Team</strong> - Working on a the ACM Executive board is a great
opportunity to develop problem solving skills, working as a team, and
communication. Be sure to faciliate developing these skills for the team and
yourself.</li>

<h2>Running an Executive Meeting<a class="headerlink" href="#running-an-executive-meeting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the past, ACM President has been responsible for driving all of the ACM
Executive meetings. This may change in the future to the Vice President -
Internal, but these tips can be transferred over to that documentation at a
later time. Here are some general tips for running an executive meeting:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Build a Schedule and Stick to It</strong> - Make sure that meetings have a purpose
and everyone is aware where you are and where you are going. The morning of
the meeting (or earlier), spend time to develop an agenda and send it out to
the Executive Board for them to review. During the meeting, ensure that you
stick to the agenda and only stray from it for a specific reason.</li>
<li><strong>Include Everyone</strong> - Try to only talk about things that are pertinent to
everyone so no one is bored. Sometimes this cannot be avoided, but you should
avoid catching up with specific sigs for prolonged periods of time. If it is
specific to a SIG and the rest of the group does not need to be present,
attend their officer meetings and discuss it directly with them.</li>
<li><strong>Past, Present, and Future</strong> - One way to structure a meeting is to start the
meeting with discussing what happened in the past, move onto things that are
currently happen, and then discuss the future. Moreover, start the meeting
with smaller topics and end with topics that take longer to discusss.</li>
<li><strong>Ask Questions and Drive Creativity</strong> - You should drive conversation to
develop the best solutions rather than assume you know the best solution.</li>
<li><strong>Decide Arguments with Reason not Authority</strong> - Arguments will eventually
happen in the Executive board, but they should always be decided by which is
the best solution for everyone.</li>
<li><strong>We are All Here for a Common Goal</strong> - Never forget that even when you are
upset with something or some decision, everyone is there for a common goal.
Disagreements should attack ideas and make sure they are the best.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tenative-schedule">
<h2>Tenative Schedule<a class="headerlink" href="#tenative-schedule" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This tenative schedule will provide a good sense of what to do month over month
as ACM President. The schedule should be continually revised and updated so
that tasks and events are properly planned for.</p>
<div class="section" id="summer">
<h3>Summer<a class="headerlink" href="#summer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Sponsorships</strong> - Q1 (January) and Q3 (August) are the primary times that
companies look for sponsorship opportunities due to budgeting. You should
spend a lot of time reaching out to companies to acquire sponsorships that
meet your projected funding goals. Before the summer is over, you should have
ideally secured 5,000+ in funding.</li>
<li><strong>Career Fair Dinner</strong> - If unfamiliar, please look at the
<a class="reference internal" href="../events/career_fair_dinner.html#events-career-fair-dinner"><span class="std std-ref">Career Fair Dinner</span></a> section. Take a look at the companies
attending the <a class="reference external" href="https://career.mst.edu/careerfair/">MST career fair</a> and
attempt to contact any looking for computer science / computer engineering
jobs. Look at the <a class="reference internal" href="../events/career_fair_dinner.html#events-career-fair-dinner"><span class="std std-ref">Career Fair Dinner</span></a> section for more specific
detials.</li>
<li><strong>Talks</strong> - ACM should attempt to get 3 companies talks for the months of
September, October, and November. <strong>TODO</strong>: Add secion on ACM Talks</li>
<li><strong>Develop a Fall Semester Plan</strong> - Loosly determine month by month what you
want to accomplish and talk about over the months to develop a rough plan for
the semester.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="august">
<h3>August<a class="headerlink" href="#august" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Recruitment</strong> - August is the primary time for recruiting new
members into ACM and the SIGs. Many people spend August looking for a new club
to join or just look to get involved. ACM meetings should be focused on
recruitment plans and planning the <strong>ACM Recruitment Drive</strong>. More
information on the <strong>ACM Recruitment Drive</strong> can be found in the
<a class="reference internal" href="../events/recruitment_drive.html#events-recruitment-drive"><span class="std std-ref">Recruitment Drive</span></a> section.</li>
<li><strong>Budgets</strong> - Work with the treasurer and the SIGs to build a budget for all
of ACM.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="september">
<h3>September<a class="headerlink" href="#september" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>September is the busiest month of the entire ACM calendar due to the fall career
fair. Be sure to delegate out tasks so that no one gets burned out and make sure
to over-communicate with everyone what is going on.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>ACM Goals</strong> - Work with the SIGs to develop goals for the semester and the
year. Build solid plans for ensuring theses goals are met and review progress
as the semester and the year progresses.</li>

Ideally you should have at most 2 events a month (except for september) and at
most 1 a night.</li>
<li><strong>Career Fair Dinner</strong> - Finish planning the career fair dinner and finalize
everyone who will be attending.</li>
<li><strong>Review Recruitment Procesess</strong> - Check-in on how recruitment went and plan
for ways to improve for next semester.</li>

<h3>October<a class="headerlink" href="#october" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Try out a New Event</strong> - Since it is right in the center, October would be a
good time to trial run a new event. See if you can come up with something
creative for a small amount of money that will attract new people.</li>
<li><strong>Review How September Went</strong> - Did the companies enjoy the talks and the
career fair dinner? What can we do next time to make sure things run smoother?
Is there anything that could improve on to attract more companies or people?</li>
<li><strong>ACM Events</strong> - Make sure that ACM events are still on schedule (MegaMiner,
etc.).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="november">
<h3>November<a class="headerlink" href="#november" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

are any improvements that could be made to provide more value to sponsors and
ACM.</li>
<li><strong>Constitution</strong> - Review the constitution. Ensure that everything is still up

<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Resume and Interviewing Workshop</strong> - Many companies have mentioned that S&amp;T
