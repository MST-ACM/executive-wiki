T-Shirt Design Contest
==========================
Every year in September, ACM hosts a T-Shirt Design Contest for our members-only
t-shirt. This section will discuss how to run the t-shirt design contest.

Design Contraints
-----------------
We usually only allow contestants to design the front of the ACM T-Shirt as the
back of the t-shirt should contain:

1. Mention of the `ACM Website <https://mstacm.org>`_
2. Logos of the sponsors

However, if the student does design a really stunning back, please work with
them to integrate these features into the design.

General Preperation
-------------------
September
^^^^^^^^^
+ **Advertisement** - Create a poster and place it around the CS building at the
  end of September. Previous examples of fliers can be found in `figma
  <https://www.figma.com/files/project/967680/Flyers>`_.
+ **Prizes** - Students should be rewarded for putting in the time and effort to
  make a good looking t-shirt for us. The prize structure we have used in the
  past is:

    + $50 Amazon Gift Card
    + The designer's signature on the t-shirt
    + A free t-shirt of their design.

October
^^^^^^^
+ **End Submissions** - End t-shirt design submissions sometime in early
  October. This is usually chosen as the second Friday in October.
+ **T-Shirt Voting** - Perform all of the voting for the best t-shirt. The
  voting structure will be discussed in the
  :ref:`events-tshirt_design_contest-voting` section.
+ **Order the New Shirts** - The t-shirt order should be put in, at the latest,
  the last week in October to ensure the t-shirt can be handed out before the
  semester gets crazy. **Be sure to finalize all sponsorship confirmations about
  being on the shirt before ordering**.
+ **Send Out Sizing Survey** - In parrallel with voting/ordering the shirt, send
  out a sizing survey to make sure that you order to right number/sizes of
  t-shirts. It is usually best to order exactly or less than this number as
  sometimes students do not pickup their shirts (but be careful with this).

November
^^^^^^^^
+ **Hand Out T-Shirts** - Host something like 'ACM Office Hours' where you have
  ACM officers sit in the CS Lounge and hand out t-shirts for a couple of hours
  each day for a week.

Voting
------
Voting for the t-shirt happens in two stages: 

    + **General Voting** - In this stage, send out all design submissions to ACM
      members and have them pick their top 3 (or use some kind of approval
      voting). Try to allow for 1 to 2 weeks for voting.
    + **Executive Board Voting** - The executive board will then take the top 3
      student-chosen designs and pick the best one at the executive meeting
      following the General Voting.
