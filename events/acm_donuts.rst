ACM Donuts
==========
**ACM Donuts** is ACM's weekly fundraiser where we sell students donuts and
potentially coffee for a discounted price. The event can also be used as a
distribution method by giving students a free donut for taking a flier or
checking out our app.

General Comments
----------------
+ It is recommended to host these on **Tuesday** since time between classes is
  longer and more students are likely to be on campus as it is the middle of the
  week.
+ **Price Guidelines** - We have chosen to use a 'pay what you want' model for
  donutes which means that students can pay anywhere from $0 to $100
  for a donut. This will promote people to come up to the table to learn
  about ACM events and activities, but also give them the possibility to help
  donate and support the event to continue. The recommend price for students
  would be $1 for donuts and $.50 for coffee, but it is recommended to change
  the price for promotions such as 'download our app for a free donut'.
+ Make sure to email donut king at dkrolla@gmail.com to ask for bulk deals and
  tell them that we are tax exempt.

Suggested Locations
-------------------
+ **Outside of the CS Building** - Ideal for a nice day. It has good traffic
  throughput through campus, would target mostly CS students, and high
  visibility.
+ **CS Building Stairs (EXPERIMENTAL)** - May be a good option for a
  rainy or particularly hot/cold day. Has the potential to be a bottleneck in
  the hallway. May potentially need another option.

Agenda
------
+ **10:15am** - Pick up donuts at Donut King (or another donut provider).
+ **10:25am** - Bring a table, ACM Donut sign, card reader, and donuts to one of
  the :ref:`events-acm_donuts-locations`.
+ **10:30m** - Begin selling donuts.
+ **11:00pm** - Stop selling donuts.
