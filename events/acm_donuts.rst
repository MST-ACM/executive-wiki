ACM Donuts
==========
**ACM Donuts** is ACM's weekly fundraiser where we sell students donuts and
potentially coffee for a discounted price. The event can also be used as
distribution method by giving students a free donut for taking a flier or
checking out our app.

General Comments
----------------
+ It is recommended to host these on **Tuesday** since time between classes is
  longer and more students are likely to be on campus as it is the middle of the
  week.

Agenda
------
+ **8:45am** - Pick up donuts at Donut King (or another donut provider)
