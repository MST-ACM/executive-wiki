ACM Donuts
==========
**ACM Donuts** is ACM's weekly fundraiser where we sell students donuts and
potentially coffee for a discounted price. The event can also be used as a
distribution method by giving students a free donut for taking a flier or
checking out our app.

General Comments
----------------
+ It is recommended to host these on **Tuesday** since time between classes is
  longer and more students are likely to be on campus as it is the middle of the
  week.
+ **Price Guidelines** - $1 for donuts and $.50 for coffee, but it is
  recommended to change the price for promotions such as 'download our app for a
  free donut'.

Suggested Locations
-------------------
+ **Outside of the CS Building** - Ideal for a nice day. It has good traffic
  throughput through campus, would target mostly CS students, and high
  visibility.
+ **CS Building Stairs (EXPERIMENTAL)** - May be a good option for a
  rainy or particularly hot/cold day. Has the potential to be a bottleneck in
  the hallway. May potentially need another option.

Agenda
------
+ **8:45am** - Pick up donuts at Donut King (or another donut provider)
+ **8:55am** - Bring a table, ACM Donut sign, card reader, and donuts to one of
  the :ref:`events-acm_donuts-locations`.
+ **9:00am** - Begin selling donuts.
+ **9:40am** - Take a break as class will have started (may potentially involve
    packing up)
+ **10:20am** - End break as class will end soon (may potentially involve setup)
+ **11:00pm** - Stop selling donuts.
