Minerama
========
**Minerama** is Missouri S&Tâ€™s annual Involvement Fair hosted by the Department
of Student Involvement. Interested students walk around the Puck (Fall) or
Havener (Spring) looking for student organizations they would potentially be
interested in and talk to them (a lot like a student organization career fair).

General Preperation
-------------------
2 Months Before
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+ **Evaluate Promotional Materials** - In order to increase ACM's exposure and
  brand recognition, ACM should develop various informational, promotional, and
  branding materials to give out during Minerama. Previous years promotional
  materials can always be utilized, but some effort should be put into looking
  into new and interesting ideas.
+ **Create Pamphlet / Handout** - Develop something for students to easily
  digest / take from the table containing information about ACM potentially
  including things like major event dates, committees, and general description.
  Minimize size and amount to read while maximizing engagement.

1 Month Before
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+ **Register to Attend** - Visit `Student Involvement's Orgsync events
  <https://orgsync.com/62431/events?view=upcoming>`_, click on Minerama for the
  semester you are registering for, and then register. Be sure to specifically
  ask for multiple tables (usually 3) as we are a large organization with many
  different committees.
+ **Order Promotional Materials** - To ensure all the materials are on time and
  to account for potential mistakes, order the finalized promotional materials
  from external sources (waterbottles, business cards, etc.) as early as
  possible.

2 Weeks Before
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+ **Develop Staffing Schedule** - At least one person from the organization must
  be at the table during the event; however, ACM should try to have at least one
  representative from every committee and ACM General (overlap included). The
  event usually runs from 10 am - 2:30 pm, but please check the official event
  for more information.
+ **Talking Points** - Each person there will represent their specific
  committee; however, they will probably need to talk about all committees to
  avoid bouncing people around to different representatives. Develop some
  general talking points / statistics about each of the committees and give
  these to all of the people staffing the table.

Schedule
-------------
+ **9:50 am** - Send someone to the Puck / Havener to register for a table.
  Then, have them reserve the table(s) with a designator such as branding
  materials or table cloth. Try to get a spot by a main pathway or with high
  visibility to students.
+ **10:20 am** (2+ people) - Collect the promotional materials, retractable
  banner, tablecloth, and other advertising / branding items. Take them to where
  Minerama is being hosted.
+ **10:30 am** - Begin setting up the table.
+ **11:00 am** - Minerama (usually) starts.
+ **2:00 pm** - Minerama (usually) ends / Clean-up begins.
+ **2:15 pm** - Finish cleanup and take all items back to the ACM office.

FAQ

How are tables assigned?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Tables are assigned on a first come first serve basis so try to register for a
table as early as possible. Make sure to check the schedule on the Orgsync page
as early as possible and send someone to check in and claim a table as early as
possible.
