Recruitment Drive
==================
The **Recruitment Drive** is ACM's primary recruitment event on the Tuesday
after Minerama (usually the first Friday of the semester). Each SIG prepares and
presents a 5-7 minute presentation about what the sig does and why students
should join their sig.

General Preperation
-------------------
2 Weeks Before
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+ **Presentation** - Each SIG should develop or update a 5-7 recruitment
  presentation about their SIG.
+ **Room Reservation** - Reserve the room. We usually use Toomey 199 in Fall and
  CS 207 in the Spring.

1 Week Before
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+ **Advertisement** - ACM should develop a flyer and hang it around the CS
  building at least 1 week before the event.
+ **Practice** - Each SIG should present their presentation to the ACM Executive
  board to iron out any potential issues and improve their presentation.

Day Of
^^^^^^
+ All of the presentations should be shared with the ACM President or other
  Executive board member so they can be setup for the drive.
+ The ACM President should develop an agenda of when each of the SIGs, ACM, and
  ACM-W will present their presentations

Agenda
-------
The ACM President should develop an agenda for which SIG will present when. Make
sure to leave 10-15 minutes after the event for people to ask questions.
Encourage the SIG chairs to stay after the presentations so that students can
come up directly and ask questions afterward.


Tips + Tricks
--------------
+ **Attendance** - The recruitment drive attedance varies greatly between Fall
  and Spring. During Fall, many new students want to become involved in students
  organizations or old students want to give student groups another shot. ACM
  and the Committees should **heavily prioritize preparing for the Fall
  recruitment drive** to attract new members and set them up for success while
  they choose to be involved in ACM. Most attendance to the Recruitment Drive is
  driven through word of mouth (i.e. friends inviting their friends say 'this
  looks cool, lets join') so try to be mindful of that with flyer
  advertisements.
+ **Keep presentations engaging but honest** - Having very impressive numbers
  join ACM through committees is great, but you must be honest with your
  expectations, what the committee does, and workloads to prevent a massive
  retention problem. Make some jokes, have some fun, but be very clear with your
  mission and objectives.
