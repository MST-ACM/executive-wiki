Career Fair Dinner
==================
The student favorite **Career Fair Dinner** is a semi-formal dinner from 6 pm -
9pm the night of the career fair that gives students and companies the
opportunity to interact for longer than a 2-minute career fair interaction.
Companies send representatives to talk to students about their comapany, take
resumes, and answer any questions the students have. The representatives rotate
throughout the night so that students talk to each company atleast once but
never the same representative throuhgout the night.
