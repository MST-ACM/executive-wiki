Reflections
===========
Whenever an officer completes their term on the Executive Board, they should
complete a reflection on their experience. The reflection should answer: what
they did or did not do well and any improvements they would have made.
Optionally, the officer can include their personal contact information so they
can be contacted in future years. Future officers can then use these reflections
as a knowledge base for their actions and plans or as a template for their
reflection.

Please see below for the catalog of previous year's reflections.
