The page will detail the general procedure for on-boarding and off-boarding
applicable for any ACM Officer. All new officers should try to read this
documentation.

  deliverables and deadlines to hold yourself accountable.

   1. ACM Officers discord
   2. `mstacm github <http://github.com/mstacm>`_
   3. `ACM bitwarden <https://bitwarden.com>`_
   4. acm-executives google group

+ Remove the previous officer from all permissions unless necessary.

Transition Steps

+ Ensure the documentation for your role is up-to-date accounting for anything
  you were confused on during the year, things missing from the original
  documentation, items that didn't make sense, permissions necessary for your
  role, and new things you did or could improve on.
+ Transfer any permissions to the new officers.

Off-boarding
------------
+ Create an entry in :ref:`officers-reflections-header`.
+ Work with the next officer to develop a plan for the next year based on your
  current experience and lessons.
