Events

This section hopes to provide some general information about how to setup, run,
and teardown an event with extra considerations.

Scheduling Considerations
-------------------------
Scheduling events is usually straight forward, but there are a couple of
considerations to keep in mind:
1. **Large Class Times** - Classes such as Data Structures, Intro to
   Programming, and Physics 2 often have large lecture sizes of ACM students
   that sometimes coincides with potential event locations / times. It may be
   wise to make a list of times at the beginning of the semester in which these
   times occurr so that you can schedule around it.
2. **Common Tests** - Certain classes such as Calculus and Physics have 'common
   test' times at 5 pm. Look at the syllabi and other resources to determine
   when these tests are to schedule around them.
3. **Other Major Events** - There are a variety of major events that occurr on /
   off campus to keep track of to avoid conflict. These include but are not
   limited to:

      + Missouri Hackathons like TigerHacks
      + Missouri S&T Greek Week
      + Prodays / Discover days
