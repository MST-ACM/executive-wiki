Marketing
=========

This section hopes to provide some basic information how how ACM does various
marketing things: making fliers, ordering marketing equipment, etc.

Flyers
-------
The majority of the marketing efforts for ACM is through flyers. Whenenver ACM
hosts an event, an effort should be made to design, develop, and post flyers
around the pertaint school buildings so that students can be made. 

.. note::
   Certain buildings will only allow you to hang fliers if there is the
   Missouri S&T logo somewhere on that flier. Moreover, before you hang up a 
   flyer in any building, be sure to ask the front office for permission.

Distributing Flyers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. **CSTask** - You can send your flyers to cstask (email maintained by the CS
   Office staff) and they will send the email out to all computer science
   students. Ask the current President for the email address for cstask.
2. **ACM Google Groups** - ACM maintains multiple google groups with student
   emails depending on the different perferences. Ask the current President for
   more information.
3. **Hanging** - cstask will also print your flyers for free. Send them the
   flyers, how many copies you want, and go pick them up from CS 325 when they
   are done. See the note above about hanging flyers. If you would like to hang
   them just around the CS building, you will need about 25 flyers.

Creating Flyers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Canva
"""""
`Canva <https://www.canva.com/>`_ is a very beginner-friendly, no design skills
necessary tool for creating fliers. I will not go into to much detail onto how
to use it, but create an account using your s&t email and play with it until you
are comfortable

Manually
""""""""
Canva is wonderful, but if you're an able designer it will probably be more
effective to create your own. You can use a tool like `Adobe Photoshop
<https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html>`_, `Adobe Illustrator
<https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html>`_, or `Figma
<https://figma.com/>`_. We prefer **Figma** because it is free for students.
The remainder of this section will focus on **Figma**.

The main step with Figma is asking the current President or Chair of sigweb to
add you to the *Missouri S&T ACM* Figma group. The design group contains all
previous flyers with Figma and other ACM assets useful in the creation of
marketing materials. When you are added to the group, you can either copy an
old flyer as a template or create a brand new design.

When you are finished, you can export the design to:

1. Select the frame, choose **PNG** as your export method, and set scaling to
   **4x** or greater (the **4x** or greater makes the image have a very high
   resolution).

.. image:: imgs/figma_export_full.png
   :alt: Figma Export Full
   :scale: 35%
   :align: center


.. image:: imgs/figma_export.png
   :alt: Figma Export
   :scale: 50%
   :align: center

2. (**Linux** and **Mac**) Use the tool ``convert`` to change png to pdf.
   (**Windows**) Use `online tool <https://png2pdf.com/>`_ to convert png to
   pdf.

   .. code-block:: console

      $ convert --quality 100 <file>.png <file>.pdf
